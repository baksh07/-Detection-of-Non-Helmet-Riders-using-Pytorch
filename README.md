# Detection-of-Non-Helmet-Riders-using-Pytorch
In this project, We have proposed a deep framework for detection of Non-Helmet Riders, We claim that our model is robust enough to differentiate between helmet and Non-helmet riders with precision.

Note- This project is implemented in pytorch

libraries to be installed are as follows:

$ pip install opencv-contrib-python
$ pip install torch
$ pip install torchvision
$ pip install imutils
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install tqdm
